# nosql-challenge

### Overview
Time to eat! The exercise ahead of us is meant to import, clean and analyze dining establishments in the UK. We'll be prepping data for the journalists and critics to help them explore the database. 

### Part 1
In the first part of the exercise, we'll set up the data. Using the provided json file, we import the databse and set up a collection, titled "establishments."

### Part 2
Next step is updating the database by adding a new establishment and removing establishments located in the local authority, Dover (maybe they're unkind to the publication). 

### Part 3
Now for the fun part- analysis! We'll explore the establishments with a variety of ratings and use the lat/lon to determine the proximity to a central point. 

### Summary
This was a fun exercise. It was interesting to see how we can use MongoDB, Pymongo and the MongoDB Compass in conjunction. Each tool was useful in setup, update and exploration/analysis.
